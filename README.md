Hello everyone, and thank you for this opportunity.

Our team has built Trust Ride – Safe & Verified Journeys, a ride-hailing safety platform that combines blockchain and AI to create trust, accountability, and transparency in everyday travel.

🌍 The Problem

Let’s start with the problem.
Ride-hailing is now a part of everyday life. But passengers often ask themselves: “Is this driver really verified? If something happens, will I be safe? Can I prove what happened during the ride?”

Right now, most apps rely on centralized databases. These can be manipulated, data can be changed, and there is little evidence if something goes wrong. Fake drivers, unsafe rides, and unverified trips are still common issues.

So we asked ourselves — how can we build a system where trust is not just promised, but guaranteed?

🚀 Our Solution – Trust Ride

That’s where Trust Ride comes in.
It’s not just another ride-hailing app — it’s a safety-first platform where every step of the journey is verifiable, tamper-proof, and transparent.

Here’s how it works:

Driver Verification

When a driver signs up, they upload their license and ID.

This data is verified, and once approved, the verification status is stored immutably on blockchain.

That means no one can fake being a verified driver.

Immutable Ride Records

When a ride is booked, details like pickup, drop, time, and fare are logged into the blockchain.

Each ride generates a unique transaction hash.

This becomes a permanent record that cannot be altered — even by us, the developers.

Safety Alerts

During a ride, if the passenger feels unsafe, they can press the panic button.

This creates a safety alert, timestamped and stored on blockchain.

It can also notify emergency contacts, making it not only verifiable but also actionable in real time.

📱 User Experience

From a user’s perspective, Trust Ride is simple and familiar:

New users sign up or log in using Google authentication.

Riders have a clean dashboard to book rides and see past ride histories.

Drivers can track their verification status and active trips.

And most importantly, there’s a Blockchain Dashboard where both riders and drivers can see ride records, verification proofs, and alerts, all tied to blockchain hashes.

This gives users confidence that every detail is genuine, visible, and permanent.

⚙️ Technology Behind Trust Ride

We built Trust Ride using:

React for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and intuitive UI/UX.

Node.js and Express for the backend APIs.

PostgreSQL for storing user and ride data.

Google Authentication for secure logins.

A mock blockchain layer that simulates real blockchain operations like transaction hashes and immutable records.

This mock blockchain can later be extended to real platforms such as Ethereum, Polygon, or Hyperledger, making the system production-ready.

🔒 Why Blockchain?

We chose blockchain because it solves the biggest gap in current ride-hailing: trust.

Centralized databases can be edited — blockchain records cannot.

Passengers don’t need to take the company’s word — they can verify proof themselves.

Authorities can rely on blockchain-backed evidence if disputes or crimes occur.

In short, blockchain makes safety verifiable and trust scalable.

🌟 The Impact

The impact of Trust Ride goes beyond just riders:

Passengers feel safe knowing their driver is truly verified.

Drivers benefit from a permanent, blockchain-backed trusted identity.

Authorities and regulators gain access to undeniable proof of rides and alerts.

This builds a transparent ecosystem where accountability is guaranteed and safety is prioritized.

🎯 Closing

To sum it up, Trust Ride is not just a ride-hailing app — it’s a safety-first platform where every driver is verified, every ride is immutably recorded, and every safety alert is permanent.

With Trust Ride, safety is no longer just a promise.
It’s something you can trust — and something you can verify.

Thank you.


I also added a AI prototype of how it would look in future:-
